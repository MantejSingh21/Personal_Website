### Co-Founder, Modelus
I’m the CTO of [Modelus](https://modelus.ai), a manufacturing co-pilot that helps pharmaceutical companies better analyze and process their QC/QA data.


### Researcher, Computational Biophotonics

I am also currently a PhD candidate in the lab of [Dr. Nicholas Durr](https://durr.jhu.edu/) where my research focuses on developing point of care medical devices for in-vivo blood cell imaging. I am interested in developing high throughput imaging systems, optimizing image acquisition pipelines and exploiting novel techniques to improve the resolution of microscopes.
